# Brain-Waves-Extraction-by-DWT-and-Classification-of-Attention-Machine-Learning
Brain waves (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Theta) are extracted by discrete wavelet transform and the machine learning algorithms are used for the detection of attention level.

Objectives: 
1. Extracting the brain waves from EEG signal by DWT
2. Calculating the power of EEG bands and classification of Attention level by brain waves ratios (Alpha-Beta Ratio, Theta-Beta Ratio etc)

How To Use The Codes:

1. EEG_Brain_Waves.m = DWT code for extracting brain waves. ( Bonus: EEG each bands maximum frequency)

2. Attention Classification Power and Ratio of Brain Waves.py = Attention Classification by calculating the power of each bands and the brain waves ratio.

3. All the relevant datas can be found on the folder named "Data"
